The idea is to find a convex hull for all the black points.
A red point will be inside a triangle of black points iff it lies inside the convex hull.
The way I check if a red point inside a convex hull is by binary search to get the possible triangle where the point might ly
inside by checking orientation. Later we check if a point is inside triangle if all 3 triangles that can be constucted inside have the same orientation.
if P is the number of black points and R is the number of red points, the complexity is
O(P + Rlog(P)) (P is time to construct the ch, Rlog(P) is the number of binary searches)
