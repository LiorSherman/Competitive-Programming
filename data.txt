The idea is to use an indicator vector representing the subgroups of the entire set.
bit i is set iff the i'th piece is in the subgroup.
Then, to use a dynamic programming -
For each possible sum of every subset of pieces we calculate the total number of distinct primary factors (the base)
Later for each of the subset groups we use to itterate over all the sub sub groups same as it was taught in class
to check the maximum revenue of the sub sub group and the complement sub sub group (using xor trick) since it was calculated
in the previous itterations.
