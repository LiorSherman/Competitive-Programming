using simple geometry and Pythagoras to find the minimum length.
Finding maximum length requires calculation of the derivation in order to find the x location between the poles s.t
the length of the ropes from each of the poles will be maximal while meeting the conditions.
O(1) for each case. (O(n) in total)
