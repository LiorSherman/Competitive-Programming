The idea is to use a union-find data structure in a way that any 2 explicit or implicit rhymes are to be found in
the same group. Later a contradiction will be found iff exist 2 words W1 and W2 s.t they are in the same group and exist
a Statement "W1 not W2" in the Input.
Includes a use of a hash map in order to translate from strings to group indexes.
