# Competitive-Programming
The repo contains solutions to various questions taken from the [ICPC International Collegiate Programming Contests](https://icpc.global/) over the years.
The questions subjects varies from basic stls, strings, graph algorythms (s.a BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, MST...), computential geometry, dynamic programming and more.
The main goal for each question is to solve it effectively in minimum time (therefore for some of the solutions, not all code conventions were preserved).
Solutions were writen in C++.
The questions themselves can be found online by looking the name of the question.
